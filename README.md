# 2016-election-data-visualization
## Capital One - MindSumo Challenge

### Patrick Pei
- The following (which is also hosted on AWS at this IP: )
is a visualization of tweets with #election through Twitter. The languages,
frameworks, and libraries that I used included JavaScript, some bash/linux
configurations (for the actual hosted instance on the web server), and 
HTML/CSS for the actual display. JQuery was used to simplify client side
scripting - abstracting away from raw XML HTTP Requests (XHR) and cleaning
up client side asset handling in requiring the JSON data. This was my
attempt to tie in Bonus 3 of "Tying in a current  or historical event such
as coverage of the 2016 US Election or the conquests of the Ottoman Empire."
